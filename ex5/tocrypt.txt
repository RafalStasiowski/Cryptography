Lithuania My fatherland you are like health How much you have to be valued only he will know who lost you Today I see and describe your beauty in all its ornaments because I miss you Holy Virgin who defend the bright Czestochowa And in the Gate of Dawn you shine You who protect the castle of Nowogrodek with its faithful people How did you miraculously recover my child When I was given to you by a crying mother I lifted my eyelid from a crying mother and I was able to walk to your temples on the threshold and thank God for my restored life In the meantime carry my longing soul To those forest hills to these green meadows stretched wide over the blue Niemen To those fields painted with various grains Gilded with wheat silver plated with rye Where amber scabies white buckwheat like snow Where the maiden blush burns woodpeckers Everything is girded with a ribbon with green copper and there are rarely silent pear trees on it In the midst of such fields on the banks of the ruczaj On a small hill in a birch grove there was a manor house made of wood but underpinned whitewashed walls shone from a distance all the whiter because they were reflected from the dark green of Topoli which protect it from the winds of autumn The house was small but littered on all sides and he had a large barn with three stacks next to it a little that could not fit under thatched roof it is evident that the area was abundant with grain And it is seen from the number of mounds which along and across the streaks shine thickly like stars  one can see from the number of plows early fields of huge fallow land black earth probably belonging to the manor well cultivated in the shape of garden beds that in this house abundance lives and order The gate still open to passers by announces that it welcomes everyone and welcomes everyone
